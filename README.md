# Ceres Fruit Juice AR Experience

## My Object
##### The Object that I have chosen to use which will be scanned by the user is a Ceres fruit Juice Box and more specifically the Grape flavour.

## My Concept
##### The Concept of my project was to take the user through a bit of a journey through the product where I would just display some infomation about the product while making it more interesting than just looking at the information on the actualy juice box.

## Built Using

* Xcode + Swift
* Reality Composer

## How to use

### Getting Started
1. Download project the project
1. Unzip the files
1. Open the Ceres.xcodeproj file in xcode
1. Plug Iphone into computer
1. Run the project on your phone
1. Follow the following steps to use the App

### Step 1
##### Firstly you need to scan your juice box, It needs to be the Ceres grape juice 1l container (See image above). If scanning was successful you should be able to see the name of the juice above it and a little welcome message. You will also then see an option to drop grapes which is my custom trigger and if you click it you will see bunches of grapes fall from the sky. These bunches of grapes are custom objects that I imported. You can then press the arrow to move on.

### Step 3 
##### Once you clicked the arrow you should be shown the ingredients of the fruit juice and then some labels on the side just saying its high in vitamin c and is preservative free. You should also see that the label drop grapes has dissapeared which is one of my custom behaviours to make it dissapear when i have moved away from the welcome section.

### Step 4
##### Clicking the arrow again will then show you the next set of information which will be the nutritional information for 1 cup or 250ml of fruit juice. The cup will also fill up soon after it appears there is also an audio of the cup filling up.

### Step 5 
##### Then finaly tapping the arrow again will take you to the final set of information which is just telling you a bit about where ceres juice in manufactured and then another custom behaviour makes the website link appear at the bottom of the screen. The idea was to be able to tap the website link and it then take you to the actuall website but I wasnt able to implement that as I think its a bit more complicated than I thought.
